Shipping Showdown

Goal:â€¨Explore how different shipping types (Drop-off, Pickup, Standard) affect sell-through rates, selling speed, and price range using a synthetic dataset modeled after Vinted.

Key Questions
* Which shipping type has the highest sell-through rate?
* How fast do items sell for each shipping method?
* Do prices vary across shipping types?

Tools & Technologies
* Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Synthetic Data Generation
* Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering

Dataset

A synthetic dataset of 10,000 second-hand fashion items, including:
* Item info (category, brand, price)
* Shipping type (Drop-off, Pickup, Standard)
* Timestamps (listing and sold dates)
* User data (rating, likes)
* Label for whether the item was sold

Key Insights
*  Drop-off shipping has the highest sell-through rate (~85%) and fastest sales.
*  Pickup and  Standard shipping have lower sell rates and slower sales.
*  Price ranges are similar, but Drop-off supports more higher-priced items.
